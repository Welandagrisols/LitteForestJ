## âœ… Completed Successfully

### New Database Tables Created

#### 1. **water_source_gallery**
This table replaces the "Impact Stories - Water" section with a dedicated water sources gallery.

**Structure:**

- `media_url` (TEXT) - URL for image/video
- `media_type` (TEXT) - Type of media (image/video)
- `caption` (TEXT) - Description/caption for the media
- `display_order` (INTEGER) - Order for displaying items
- `is_active` (BOOLEAN) - Whether the item is visible
- `created_at` & `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Auto-managed timestamps

**Features:**
- Indexes on `display_order` and `is_active` for fast queries
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Auto-updating `updated_at` trigger

#### 2. **green_champions_gallery**
This table manages the Green Champions (schools) gallery.

**Structure:**
- `id` (UUID) - Primary key
- `school_name` (TEXT) - Name of the school
- `media_url` (TEXT) - URL for image
- `caption` (TEXT) - Description/caption for the media
- `display_order` (INTEGER) - Order for displaying items
- `is_active` (BOOLEAN) - Whether the item is visible
- `created_at` & `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Auto-managed timestamps

**Features:**
- Indexes on `display_order` and `is_active` for fast queries
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Auto-updating `updated_at` trigger

### TypeScript Types Updated

The `types/supabase.ts` file has been updated with complete type definitions for both new tables, including:
- Row types (for reading)
- Insert types (for creating)
- Update types (for modifying)

### Database Files Created

1. **scripts/create-green-towns-tables.sql** - Complete migration script
2. **Types added to types/supabase.ts** - TypeScript definitions

## Product Display Layout

**No database changes needed!** The product display layout changes are purely frontend modifications and don't affect the existing `inventory` table structure.

## Migration Notes

- The old `impact_stories` table was not found in the database, so no data migration was needed
- You can start fresh with the new Green Towns Initiative structure
- All tables have proper security policies and performance indexes

## Next Steps

To start using these tables in your application:

1. **Update the UI components:**
   - Replace "Impact Stories" references with "Green Towns Initiative"
   - Create new forms for adding water sources and green champions
   - Update the display components to use the new table structure

2. **Add media to water sources:**
   - Upload images/videos for each spring
   - Add captions and set display order
   
3. **Add green champions data:**
   - Add schools and their green initiatives
   - Upload related images

4. **Test the workflow:**
   - Verify CRUD operations work correctly
   - Check that media uploads function properly
   - Ensure proper sorting by `display_order`

All database setup is complete and ready for implementation! ðŸŽ‰
